This document outlines the experimental design for testing the impact of our newly tuned SVD model.

## 1. Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (H 
0
​
 ): The recommendations generated by the tuned SVD model will result in no change in user click-through rate compared to the recommendations from the original, untuned SVD model.

Alternative Hypothesis (H 
A
​
 ): The recommendations generated by the tuned SVD model will result in a statistically significant increase in user click-through rate.

## 2. Key Metrics & KPIs
Primary Metric: Click-Through Rate (CTR) on recommended items. This will be the sole metric used to determine the winner of the experiment. It is calculated as (Number of Clicks on Recommendations) / (Number of Recommendation Lists Shown).

Secondary Metrics: We will also monitor these to understand the broader impact:

User Session Duration: Does the new model encourage users to stay longer?

Recommendation Coverage: Is the new model recommending a wider or narrower set of movies?

Ratings per Session: Are users more engaged and rating more movies?

## 3. Experimental Setup
Control Group (Group A): A portion of users (50%) will continue to receive recommendations generated by the original SVD model (svd_model.pkl).

Treatment Group (Group B): The other 50% of users will receive recommendations from our new, tuned SVD model (svd_tuned_model.pkl).

User Assignment: Users will be randomly assigned to a group upon their first visit. The assignment will be persistent, meaning a user will stay in the same group for the duration of the test.

## 4. Statistical Plan
Sample Size: Before starting, we would perform a power analysis to determine the number of users needed in each group to detect a meaningful lift (e.g., a 5% relative increase in CTR) with 80% statistical power and a 95% confidence level.

Test Duration: The test will run for a minimum of two full weeks to account for any weekly seasonality in user behavior.

Significance Test: We will use a two-proportion Z-test to compare the CTRs of the two groups. We will consider a result statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05.

## 5. Decision Framework
If the Treatment Group (Tuned SVD) shows a statistically significant increase in the primary metric (CTR), and no significant negative impact on secondary metrics, we will declare it the winner and roll out the tuned model to 100% of users.

If there is no statistically significant difference, or if the new model causes a negative impact, we will stick with the original model and analyze the results to inform the next iteration.
