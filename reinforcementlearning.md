What is RL in Recommendations?
All the models we have built so far are static. They learn from a fixed dataset and make a single, one-time prediction. RL is different. It's about learning the best sequence of actions to take to maximize a long-term reward, like user engagement over a month.

The most practical and intuitive starting point for RL in recommender systems, as noted in your roadmap, is the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem.

## üí° The Concept: Multi-Armed Bandits
Imagine you're in a casino facing several slot machines (the "bandits"). Each has a different, unknown probability of paying out. You have a limited number of coins. What's your strategy?

Exploitation: Do you keep pulling the lever on the machine that has given you the best results so far?

Exploration: Do you try other machines to see if they might be even better?

This is the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. A Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm is a mathematical solution to this problem. In our case:

The "Arms" are our different recommendation models (SVD, Hybrid, Sequential, etc.).

The "Reward" is a user clicking on a recommended movie (we'll simulate this as a 1 for a click, 0 for no click).

The goal is to build an algorithm that, over time, learns which of our models is most effective at generating engaging recommendations for users.

## üöÄ Proposed Next Step: Implementing a Bandit Simulation
Implementing a full, live RL system is extremely complex. A more practical and educational next step is to simulate a Multi-Armed Bandit to see how it works.

Our plan would be:

Frame the Problem: We will treat our existing models (let's pick 3 for simplicity: SVD, Sequential, Autoencoder) as the "arms" of our bandit.

Simulate a "True" Click-Through Rate: We'll assign a hypothetical, "true" probability of success to each model (e.g., SVD gets a click 10% of the time, Sequential 15%, etc.). Our algorithm won't know these numbers.

Implement Thompson Sampling: We'll code the Thompson Sampling algorithm, a powerful bandit strategy that uses probability distributions to intelligently balance exploration and exploitation.

Run the Simulation: We'll run the simulation for thousands of "users" and watch as the algorithm tries different models, observes the outcomes (simulated clicks), and gradually learns to favor the best-performing one.


## üß† The Concept: How Thompson Sampling Works
Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic algorithm that elegantly balances exploration and exploitation. For each "arm" (our recommender models), it doesn't just track the average success rate; it maintains a full probability distribution of what the success rate might be.

Here's the process for each user interaction:

Sample: For each model, it draws a random sample from its current probability distribution (we'll use the Beta distribution, which is perfect for this).

Select: It chooses the model that produced the highest random sample for this round.

Observe & Update: It observes the outcome (a simulated click or no click) and updates the probability distribution for the model that was chosen, making it more accurate for the next round.

This way, models that perform well will have their distributions shift towards higher values and get picked more often (exploitation), while uncertain or poorly-performing models still get a chance to be picked if they produce a lucky high sample (exploration).




The core of an interactive system is giving users control and learning from their immediate feedback. We will design a simple but powerful feedback loop that allows the system to adapt to a user's preferences in real-time.

## 1. The Front-End Concept: Explicit Feedback
Imagine in our user interface, next to each recommended movie, we add two simple buttons:

"More like this üëç"

"Less of this üëé"

This is a form of explicit feedback. It allows the user to directly tell the system about their preferences for the type of content being recommended.

When a user clicks "More like this üëç" on an action movie, they are signaling a current interest in the action genre.

When they click "Less of this üëé", they are signaling that they are not in the mood for that type of movie right now.

## 2. The Back-End: A Feedback API Endpoint
To handle this feedback, we need to create a new API endpoint. This endpoint won't return recommendations; its sole job is to receive and process the user's feedback.

A. Endpoint Design
We'll create a POST endpoint at /feedback because the user is submitting new data to our system.

B. Data Structure
When a user clicks a button, the front-end will send a JSON object to this endpoint with the following structure:

JSON

{
    "user_id": 196,
    "movie_id": 242,
    "feedback_type": "dislike" // can be "like" or "dislike"
}



# --- Long-Term Adaptation (Future Implementation) ---
    # In a production system, you would log this feedback to a database.
    # A 'like' could be treated as a 5-star rating for future retraining.
    # A 'dislike' could be treated as a 1-star rating.


 # --- Short-Term Adaptation (Conceptual) ---
    # For a 'dislike', we could temporarily penalize similar movies for this user's session.
    # For a 'like', we could boost similar movies.
