 Designing the Hybrid Logic
Before coding, let's define the core logic. For a given user:

Identify Taste Profile: We need to know what the user likes. We'll find all movies the user has rated highly (e.g., 4 stars or more). These movies represent the user's "taste profile."

Generate Candidates: Get a list of potential recommendations from the SVD model. We'll generate a slightly larger list than we need (e.g., top 50 candidates) to give our reranking process room to work.

Calculate Hybrid Score: For each candidate movie, we'll compute a score using this formula:

Hybrid Score=(α×SVD Score)+((1−α)×Content Score)
SVD Score: The predicted rating from our SVD model.

Content Score: The average similarity of this candidate movie to all the movies in the user's "taste profile."

α (alpha): A weight we can tune. An alpha of 0.7 means we trust the SVD score for 70% of the decision and the content score for 30%. We'll start with 0.7.
